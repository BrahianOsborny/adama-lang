# History and Motivations behind Adama (i.e. Why!?!)

**"Why"** is a very hard (and sometimes painful) question to answer because it cuts so deep, and the answer boils down to the a motivating problem, some values held by the inventor, and a whole lot of frustration.

It all starts with the [original design to bring friends together around an online Battlestar Galatica (the board game)](origins.md). However, the mind breaking complexity of the interplay of all the rules and player capabilities required a new kind of thing. That new thing had to manifest some values, and those values are simply:

* [Laziness](laziness.md) which makes the job easier to get done with more capabilities.
* [Affordability](./affordability.md) because the solution shouldn't break the bank and good things happen when costs trend towards zero.
* [Stability](stability.md) because a thing built today should work tomorrow until the heat death of the universe.
* [Fun](fun.md) because building should be fun.

Now, the funny bit is that this all started with a couple of tools to make representing state easier, and then it turned into a giant document store with a full programming language. It wasn't planned, but it's pretty neat. [This lead to a post-hoc attempt to define what this thing even is:](/what/post-hoc.md)
