# Reference

For more information on how to authenticate to Adama, see [the Authentication section](./auth.md)

The [Javascript API Reference](./api.md) details the various methods found on the JavaScript client library once connected, and
it's helpful to refer to [JavaScript Connection and Authentication](./auth.md) to setup a connection and how to authenticate each method call.
If you are using a language other than JavaScript, then the [JSON Delta Format](./deltas.md) is useful for understanding how to reconstruct JSON objects for document connections.

The [Standard Library](./stdlib.md) outlines the built-in functions that Adama provides developers without the need to reach out to [remote services](/guide/services.md).
