# Installing the tool

First thing you need to do is install Java. [Please refer to Oracle's website for how to install Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)

When the command:
```shell
java -version
```

shows something like
```shell
openjdk version "11.0.13" 2021-10-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.13+8-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.13+8-Ubuntu-0ubuntu1.20.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Then we are in business!

* Download the tool from GitHub release (or Web Site); we release weekly updates
