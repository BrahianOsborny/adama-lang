There is some external tooling to make some of the values here correct, and that tooling should be part of adama.jar along with instructions about how to fully test all the DB stuff (and what-not)

mv me.identity github/adama-lang/common/localhost.identity
cp common/localhost.identity saas/localhost.identity
cp common/localhost.identity system/localhost.identity
cp common/localhost.identity net/localhost.identity
cp common/localhost.identity overlord/localhost.identity
