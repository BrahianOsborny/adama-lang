## Fast Intro

As Adama is [a data-centric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-centric_programming_language), the first order of business is to organize your [data for state management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_management). At the document level, state is laid out as a series of fields. For instance, the below Adama code outlines three fields:
```adama
public string output;
private double balance;
int count;
```

These three fields will establish a persistent document in JSON:
```json
{"output":"","balance":0.0,"count":0}
```

The [*public* and *private*](/docs/reference-privacy-and-bubbles) modifiers control what users will see, and the omission of either results in *private* by default. In this case, users will see:
```json
{"output":""}
````
when they [connect to the document](/docs/reference-connection-events).

## Diving Into Details

The syntax which Adama parses for this is as follows:
```regex
(privacy)? type name (= expression)?;
```

**such that**
* _privacy_ when set may be *private*, *public*, or anything outlined in [the privacy section](/docs/reference-privacy-and-bubbles). In this context, *private* means only the system and code within Adama can see the field while *public* means the system, the code, and any human viewer may see the field. [The privacy section](/docs/reference-privacy-and-bubbles) will outline other ways for humans to see the field.
* _privacy_ when omitted results in a default value of *private* which means no users can see the field.
* _type_ is the type of the data. See [types for more details](#types).
* _expression_ when provided will be computed at the [construction](/docs/reference-constructor) of the document.

The privacy policy of this document is limited and lacks data that users want to and should see. This is unfortunate, but can be corrected by changing the document to
```adama
public string output = "Hello World"
private double balance = 13.42;
public int count = 42;
```

which results in the document persisted and viewed by all with slightly more meaningful data in JSON:
```json
{"output":"Hello World","count":42}
```

## Built-in Types
Adama has many built-in types, and the following tables outline which types are available.

| type | contents | default | fun example |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bool | bool can have one of the two values *true* or *false*. | false | true |
| int | int is a signed [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) number that uses 32-bits. This results in valid values between âˆ’2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. | 0 | 42 |
| long | long is a signed [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) number that uses 64-bits. This results in valid values between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and +9,223,372,036,854,775,807.  | 0 | 42 |
| double | double is a floating-point type which uses 64-bit IEEE754. This results in a range of 1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits). | 0.0 | 3.15 |
| string | string is a [utf-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded collection of code-points. | "" (empty string) | "Hello World" |
| label | label is a pointer to a block of code which is used by [the state machine](/docs/reference-state-machine), | # (the no-state) | #hello |
| client | client is a reference to a connected person, and the backing data establishes who they are. This is used for [acquiring data and decisions from people](/docs/reference-channels-handlers-futures), | @no_one | @no_one |

## Call-out to other types

The above built-in types are building blocks for richer types, and the below table provides callouts to other type mechanisms. Not all types are valid at the document level.

| type | quick call out                                                                                                                                     | applicable to document/record |
|  --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --- |
| [enum](/docs/reference-enumerations-dynamic-dispatch) | An **enum**eration is a type that consists of a finite set of named constants.                                                                     | yes |
| [messages](/docs/reference-defining-structure-types) | A **message** is a collection of variables grouped under one name used for communication.                                                          | no |
| [records](/docs/reference-defining-structure-types) | A **record** is a collection of variables grouped under one name used for persistence.                                                             | yes |
| [maybe](/docs/reference-maybe-types) | Sometimes things didn't or can't happen, and we use **maybe** to express that absence rather than null. Monads for the win!                        | yes (only of applicable types) |
| [table](/docs/reference-tables-linq) | A **table** forms the ultimate collection enabling maps, lists, sets, and more. Tables use **record**s to persist information in a structured way. | yes |
| [channel](/docs/reference-channels-handlers-futures) | Channels enable communication between the document and people via handlers and **future**s.                                                        | only root document |
| [future](/docs/reference-channels-handlers-futures) | A future is a result that will arrive in the **future**.                                                                                           | no |
| [maps](/docs/reference-maps-and-reduce) | A **map** enables associating keys to values, but they can also be the result of a reduction.                                                      | not yet |
| [lists](/docs/reference-tables-linq) | A **list** is created by using language integrated query on a table                                                                                | only via a formula |
| arrays | An array is a finite collection of a adjacent items                                                                                                | no |
