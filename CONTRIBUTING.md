# Contributing to Adama

[Adama Platform](http://www.adama-platform.com) is an exciting paradigm shift, and we are happy to have contributions.

## Code of Conduct

[Adama Platform](http://www.adama-platform.com) has embraced a simplified [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect everyone to follow.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to Adama. However, as an ideal requirement, you should be familiar with Adama and have used it in a meaningful way.
Hopefully, you aim to contribute as you may have run into a wall with the platform as it has limits and awkwardness.

### Join discord
The ['#contrib' channel in the Adama discord](https://discord.gg/zRYYgKkGKg) is the primary place for real-time communication.

## Development philosophy and the mono-repo
Adama doesn't leverage branches, and once a diff has been integrated then it will be heading to production.
This is why Adama requires excellent unit test coverage, so every diff must have excellent code coverage.
